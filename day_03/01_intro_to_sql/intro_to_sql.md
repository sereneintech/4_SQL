# Intro to SQL

Databases are a vital part of any application. Without them there is no way to store any information relevant to the app or any records of users, orders, or bookings. That might sound great from a personal perspective (no more targeted ads because you looked at something online that one time) but it would also mean we couldn't browse Netflix or sell stuff on eBay. 

Databases come in two different types: **relational** and **non-relational**. The fundamentals are the same, but there is a key difference in terms of structure. Everything we enter into a relational database must follow a clearly-defined format and we can be sure when we read from it that the results will contain the data we need. Non-relational databases are much more flexible and give the user a greater degree of freedom in terms of how they are utilised.

The two types are often referred to as **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases. SQL stands for **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage but it in fact covers many different varieties - examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2 and many more. Each has slight differences, but the fundamentals are the same. Often these fundamentals are taken care of for us by a tool known as an **Object-Relational Mapper** or **ORM**, but knowing how to manually check what the tools are doing for us is still a vitally important skill.

## Setting Up a Database

The data we enter into our database will be stored in **tables**. Tables consist of **columns**, which denote the values being stored, and **rows**, which represent the entries made. In order to set up a table in our database we need to specify the name we want to refer to it by, which should be plural. In this example we're going to keep track of actors and the movies they appear in.

We can begin by creating a psql database locally, to store our data. `createdb` is a command we have access to as we have previously installed Postgres.

```shell
createdb cinema
```

Now that our database exists, we can create a file to store our SQL code.

```shell
touch cinema.sql
```
We can now start by creating a `movies` table. We need to define the columns, including the **type** of data stored in each. These types are similar to those we've seen already, but have slightly different names (see link at the bottom of this document for a full list). By specifying a type for each column we help prevent data being entered inaccurately.

Once we store our data we'll need to refer back to it at some point, but that can be quite a challenge. If we have two movies with the same title, how can we tell them apart? To address this we'll add a column called `id` which will store a unique identifier for each row. This will have a special type called `SERIAL`, which looks like any other number but has special significance to the database management tool. Serials are assigned automatically when a row is added and won't be reused when a row is deleted, removing a potential source of user error.

```sql
-- cinema.sql

CREATE TABLE movies (
	id SERIAL,
	title VARCHAR(255),
	duration INT,
	rating VARCHAR(255)
);
```
> `(255)` is used because it's the largest number of characters that can be counted with an 8-bit number. It maximizes the use of the 8-bit count, without frivolously requiring another whole byte to count the characters above 255. (answered by Robert Harvey, StackOverflow)

Great! We now have the instructions for PSQL to create a table for us. But how do we run this code? We are accustomed to Intellij doing this for us through our ▶️ button, but we can ask Terminal to run this code for us:

```shell
psql -d cinema -f cinema.sql
```
We should receive some feedback (see below) which indicates that we have successfully created a `movies` table.

```shell
CREATE TABLE
```
We can also check that this has worked by writing a `SELECT` query. We will talk more about reading from our database shortly, but let us write some code right now that allows us to look at our `movies` table. This lets us visually see the work we are doing as we go along.

```sql
-- cinema.sql

CREATE TABLE movies(
	id SERIAL,
	title VARCHAR(255),
	duration INT,
	rating VARCHAR(255),
)

SELECT * FROM movies;		-- ADDED
```

In order to see the result of the select, we will need to run the file again (`psql -d cinema -f cinema.sql`). Before we do that, we should note that throughout this lesson (and a future lesson on `Advanced Select`) we will be running this code many times. To avoid having multiple entries of the same data, are going to add another command to the top of our file:

```sql
-- cinema.sql

DROP TABLE movies;	-- ADDED

CREATE TABLE movies(
	id SERIAL,
	title VARCHAR(255),
	duration INT,
	rating VARCHAR(255),
)
```

Now we can run our file again to see the table we created.

```shell
psql -d cinema -f cinema.sql
```


## Basic Operations - CRUD

### Create

There's no point in having a database if we don't store any information in it. The keyword we use adding new information is `INSERT` and the query follows this format:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
``` 

We'll add some movies to our table:

```sql
INSERT INTO movies (title, duration, rating) VALUES ('Alien', 117, '18');
INSERT INTO movies (title, duration, rating) VALUES ('The Imitation Game', 114, '12A');
INSERT INTO movies (title, duration, rating) VALUES ('Iron Man', 126, '12A');
INSERT INTO movies (title, duration, rating) VALUES ('The Martian', 144, '12A');
```

Note that we don't need to include the `id` column here. Because we gave it the type `SERIAL` the database manager will take care of that for us and auto-assign a value to each new entry.

What happens if we miss out some of the information?

```sql
INSERT INTO movies (title, rating) VALUES ('Braveheart', 'PG');
```

Because we're using a relational database there needs to be *something* in the duration column, but we haven't provided anything. The database manager ensures there's a value there by inserting `NULL` instead. We can force the user to provide a value by adding `NOT NULL` after the column's data type when we set up our table.

### Read

Just like there's no point in having an empty database, there's no point putting things in if we're never going to look at them again. We can read information from the database using the `SELECT` keyword. The simplest thing we could do is read *everything* from our table, which we do with this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies;
```

Obviously that's not always going to be practical. We can limit the reults in two ways: by column and by row. Replacing the `*` with one or more column names will only give us certain pieces of information back:

```sql
SELECT title FROM movies;
```

We get the requested information for each row in the table. If we want to limit the number of rows we can do so using the `WHERE` keyword:

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE rating = 'PG';
```

We aren't limited to checking equality, we can compare values (`>`, `<`) and check negatives using `NOT`. We can combine the two as well:

```sql
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE duration > 120;
```

### Update

Once something has been added to our database we may want to change it at a later point. The `UPDATE` keyword lets us do this and the syntax is similar (although not exactly the same) as adding a new item. We need to be more careful here though, since we don't want to accidentally modify more than we need to. Just like we do when we `SELECT`, we can use the `WHERE` keyword to limit the rows we are updating. Usually we will use the `id` property to ensure we only update a specific row, but there may be occasions where we want to use something else to update multiple rows at once.

```sql
UPDATE movies SET rating = '12A' WHERE id = 5;
```

The syntax is slightly different if we want to update multiple columns, where we need to add brackets around the column names and values:

```sql
UPDATE movies SET (duration, rating) = (178, '15') WHERE id = 5;
```

### Delete

The final core action will enable us to remove entries from our database. Again we need to be careful and use `WHERE` to make sure we only remove what we want to.

```sql
DELETE FROM movies WHERE id = 5;
```

If we leave out the `WHERE` clause we'll end up deleting **everything** in the table!

```sql
DELETE FROM movies;
```
